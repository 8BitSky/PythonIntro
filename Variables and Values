#Variable and Values
#Variables are "things" that can be changed
#Variables are representations of "something"
#Values are the actual data!

#A Python variable is a symbolic name that is a reference or pointer to an object. 
#Once an object is assigned to a variable, you can refer to the object by that name.

human2 = 'Christian'
human3 = 'Alex'
human4 = 'Seth'

#Print all names in a line
print('Attendance:')

#Print all names vertically
print('Attendance:')
print(human1)
print(human2)
print(human3)
